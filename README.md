# My LeetCode Practice Repository

Hello everyone! This repository is a compilation of my solutions to various problems on LeetCode. I've divided the solutions based on the strategy used for solving the problem.

Here's a quick overview of the different strategies and the corresponding directories:

## Directories Overview:

### 1. Nums :
    Problems solved using numerical computations and algorithms.
   
### 2. HashMap :
    Problems solved using hash maps, which offer fast data retrieval and manipulation.
   
### 3. Nums and Positions :
    Problems that require consideration of both numbers and their positions in a list or array.
   
### 4. Stack and Recursion :
    Problems solved using either stacks or recursion, often relating to the depth-first search algorithm.
   
### 5. String :
    Problems that deal with manipulation and computation on strings.
   
### 6. Two Pointers :
    Problems where the two-pointer technique is useful, often for searching pairs or sequences in an array.
   
### 7. HashSet :
    Problems solved using hash sets, providing efficient search and storage operations.
    
I will continue to update this repository as I solve more problems and encounter new strategies.
